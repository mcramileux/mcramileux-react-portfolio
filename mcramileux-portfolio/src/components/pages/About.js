                I am Kristine, an aspiring web developer currently engaged in online studies at the University of Adelaide. As the culmination of my studies approaches at the end of this month, I am eager to expand my skill set and embrace new opportunities, with coding being a central focus of my learning journey.

                My professional background spans a decade in the Hospitality Industry, reflecting my dedication and adaptability. Seeking a more balanced lifestyle, I am embarking on a career transition into the field of web development, where I am driven to leverage my newfound skills to make a meaningful impact.

                Throughout my coding bootcamp experience, I have diligently undertaken a range of projects, which I am pleased to present in my portfolio. I invite you to explore these endeavors, and should you have any inquiries or wish to discuss my work further, I am readily available for communication.
